    "story-cica12": "Max was surrendered by his previous owner because they found him 'too lazy'. But we absolutely love his slow pace and his majestically grumpy gaze! He is a calm, but extremely intelligent 'grumpy boss' who can only be lured out with the finest treats. He's an ideal companion for those who appreciate a quiet, balanced cat friend.",
